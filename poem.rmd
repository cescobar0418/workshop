## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
I am mad with love  
And no one understands my plight.  
 Only the wounded  
 Understand the agonies of the wounded,  
 When the fire rages in the heart.  
 Only the jeweller knows the value of the jewel,  
 Not the one who lets it go.  
 In pain I wander from door to door,  
 But could not find a doctor.  
 Says Mira: Harken, my Master,  
 Mira’s pain will subside  
 When Shyam comes as the doctor.
